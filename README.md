# Multi-Slot Clipboard Manager

Tired of copying and pasting one thing at a time?  
With the **Multi-Slot Clipboard Manager**, you can save multiple clipboard entries (up to 9) and recall them anytime with simple keyboard shortcuts.

##  Features
-  **Multi-slot clipboard** → Save up to 9 different text entries.  
-  **Quick access** → Use simple hotkeys to store and paste.  
-  **Cross-platform design** → Works on macOS (tested) and adaptable for Windows/Linux.  
-  **Terminal feedback** → Shows what’s saved/pasted in real-time.  

---

##  Usage
### On macOS:
- **Save to slot:**  
  Press `Cmd + C + <num>` → saves current copied text into slot `<num>`  
  Example: `Cmd + C + 1` → Saves clipboard into Slot 1  

- **Paste from slot:**  
  Press `Ctrl + <num>` → sets slot `<num>` back into clipboard  
  Then press `Cmd + V` normally to paste.

##  Future Enhancements
-  **Native notifications** → Show popup alerts when text is saved/pasted to slots.  
-  **Direct auto-paste (Windows)** → Simulate `Ctrl+V` automatically after recalling slot.  
-  **GUI manager** → A small window to view, edit, and manage all slots visually.  
-  **Auto-start on boot** → Make the clipboard manager run automatically when your PC starts, so you don’t need to manually launch it every time.  
-  **Cloud sync (optional)** → Sync clipboard slots across devices.
